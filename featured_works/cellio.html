            Oriane Consulting, founded by Julie Sunderland (former Director of the Gates Strategic Investment Fund),
            oversees multiple biotech startups.
            She has different levels of involvement in each company. At <strong>Cellio</strong>,
            Julie acts as the founding CEO. The team is comprised top-tier ophthalmologists, scientists, and academics.
            My
            role was to assist her with the business side, focusing on fundraising and operations.
            <br><br>
            With limited biotech training, my fresh perspective was crucial in distilling over a decade of R&D into a
            concise and compelling narrative for investors. Utilizing my pitch deck and data room, Cellio is poised to
            close a hefty Series A round to advance through in-human clinical
            trials.

            I streamlined project management by transitioning the team from chaotic email threads to an organized
            AirTable system, managing task lists at every all-hands meeting. When the leadership team and investors
            expressed concerns
            about production time and cost per dose, I
            led a team to address these issues. By empathizing with stakeholders, identifying redundancies, and
            re-evaluating timelines, we reduced production time by 115 days and cut costs by $185k. This efficiency gain
            earned me equity from the grateful founder team.
