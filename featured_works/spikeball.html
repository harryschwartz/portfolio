            One of the rites of passage for any mechanical engineer at Stanford is ME203, a class where students spend
            practically all their free time in the Product Realization Lab, or "PRL", learning how to use mills,
            saws, lathes, etc. The point of this infamous gauntlet is to embue students with the confidence to learn new processes and
            actually build the products in their sketchbooks.
             The focus of the course is an open-ended personal project where
            you design and build something in one quarter. The only constraint is that you must use the processes taught in class.
            <br><br>
            I chose to build a Spikeball net because the game holds a special place in my heart. The game, akin to a mix
            of volleyball and four-square, was a perfect pastime for my high school friend group, offering a way to stay active
            without the intensity of our regular sporting commitments. The friends I made through Spikeball remain my
            closest friends to this day. Inspired by the lasting camaraderie, I designed and manufactured a
            detachable steel Spikeball Net in the spirit of bonding with new friends in college.
