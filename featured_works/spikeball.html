            One of the rites of passage for any mechanical engineer at Stanford is ME203, a class where students spend
            practically all their free time in the infamous Product Realization Lab, learning how to use machines and
            shop methods to bring their ideas to life. The focus of the course is an open-ended personal project where
            you design and build a product with the processes taught in the class.
            <br><br>
            I chose to build a Spikeball net because the game holds a special place in my heart. The game, akin to a mix
            of volleyball and four-square, was a perfect pastime for my friends and me, offering a way to stay active
            without the intensity of our regular sporting commitments. The friends I played with regularly remain my
            best friends to this day. Inspired by the camaraderie I found with those boys, I designed and manufactured a
            detachable steel Spikeball Net, hoping it would keep us connected and bring others together through this
            exhilarating game.
