            When the COVID-19 pandemic abruptly interrupted our senior year, we found ourselves finishing college
            remotely, missing out on crucial in-person experiences. To preserve our memories and connections, we created
            "Yearbook," a dedicated website for the class of 2020. This platform allowed classmates to leave messages,
            share memories, and express affirmations. Our design goal was to create a low-pressure forum where everyone,
            not just close friends, could express appreciation and gratitude. Through extensive design research,
            wireframing, UI/UX design, product management, branding, and marketing, we brought this heartfelt project to
            life.
