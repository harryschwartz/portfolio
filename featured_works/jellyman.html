            Luke Wood and Donald Glover believed that consumers
            would crave engaging physical experiences coming out of the pandemic so they started The Big Global Company, a
            collective aiming to "express magical spaces in real-life places".
            I played a key
            role in their first venture: <strong>Jellyman</strong>.
            <br><br>
            Inspired by Taiwan’s obsessive boba culture, Jellyman is elevating the quality and community experience
            of boba in the US, starting with Silverlake (Luke and Donald’s local neighborhood).

            The responsibilities of a Chief of Staff are impossible to describe because they vary from company to company 
            and likely change on a day to day basis. Here are some examples of my contributions to this project:
            
            <br><br>
            From day one, I was the glue between Team Luke, Team Donald, Mitch (our valiant project lead), and all
            third-party contractors. 
            I toured countless sites in Silverlake to find the perfect location on Sunset Junction. I sourced top-tier talent from across the
            country, including boba chefs and
            "bobaristas," and delved deep into the boba-making process, understanding the cost and floor plan needs for
            our kitchen. Through comprehensive market research and competitive analysis of LA's boba scene, I helped differentiate
            the brand -
            known for it's mysterious online presence, unique cups, funky menu, and beautiful space. 
            <br><br>
            In a way, my job was easy because I was surrounded by such tremendous talent. With legendary architect Barbara Bestor and designer Jesse Fresnedi on board, we ensured every
            aspect of the experience was perfect.
            Luke and Donald’s combined digital marketing and storytelling power has made Jellyman a viral sensation.
            Jellyman is the newest vibrant community hub
            in Silverlake. Go check it out if you are ever in the area!
