            Luke Wood and Donald Glover believed that consumers
            would crave engaging physical experiences coming out of the pandemic so they started The Big Global Company, a
            collective aiming to "express magical spaces in real-life places".
            I played a key
            role in their first venture: <strong>Jellyman</strong>.
            <br><br>
            Inspired by Taiwan's obsessive boba culture, Jellyman is elevating the quality and community experience
            of boba in the US, starting with Silverlake (Luke and Donald's local neighborhood).

            The responsibilities of a Chief of Staff are impossible to describe because they vary from company to company 
            and likely change on a day to day basis. Here are some examples of my contributions to this project:
            
            <br><br>
            From day one, I was the glue between Team Luke, Team Donald, Mitch (our valiant project lead), and all
            third-party contractors. 
            I toured countless sites in Silverlake to find the perfect location on Sunset Junction. I sourced top-tier talent from across the
            country, including boba chefs and
            "bobaristas," and delved deep into the boba-making process, understanding the cost and floor plan needs for
            our kitchen. 
            <br><br>
            A crucial part of my role involved extensive market research. I compiled comprehensive data on menu offerings, PP&E (Property, Plant, and Equipment), and design elements of over 50 major global boba brands into detailed spreadsheets. This research was instrumental in shaping Jellyman's brand differentiation within our budget constraints. It informed our decisions on everything from unique cup designs and our funky menu to the overall aesthetic of our space, helping us create a distinct identity in the competitive LA boba scene.
            <br><br>
            In a way, my job was easy because I was surrounded by such tremendous talent. 
            With legendary LA architect Barbara Bestor and Boba Guy's original Chief Culinary Officer Jesse Fresnedi on board, our team ensured
            every aspect of the experience down to the last detail was curated with intention.
            Luke and Donald's combined cultural storytelling and digital marketing power made Jellyman an instant viral sensation.
            It has successfully become a vibrant "third space" for the Silverlake community.
