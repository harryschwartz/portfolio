            Despite a general negative sentiment toward's brick and mortar post-pandemic, Luke Wood and Donald Glover believed that consumers
            still craved engaging physical experiences so they started The Big Global Company, a collective aiming to "express magical spaces in real-life places".
            I played a key
            role in helping them launch their first venture: <strong>Jellyman</strong>.
            <br><br>
            Inspired by Taiwan’s obsessive boba culture, Jellyman is elevating the quality and community experience
            of boba in the US, starting with Silverlake (Luke and Donald’s local neighborhood).

            Through comprehensive market research and competitive analysis of LA's boba scene, I helped differentiate the brand -
            known for it's mysterious online presence, unique cups, funky menu, and beautiful space. 
            From day one, I was the glue between Team Luke, Team Donald, Mitch (our valiant project lead), and all third-party contractors. 
            Mitch and I visited multiple sites in
            Silverlake to find the perfect location on Sunset Junction. I sourced top-tier talent from across the
            country, including boba chefs and
            "bobaristas," and delved deep into the boba-making process, understanding the cost and floor plan needs for
            our kitchen. With legendary architect Barbara Bestor and designer Jesse Fresnedi on board, we ensured every
            aspect of the experience was perfect.
            Luke and Donald’s combined digital marketing and storytelling power has made Jellyman a viral sensation.
            Jellyman is not just a premium boba shop but a vibrant community hub
            in Silverlake.
