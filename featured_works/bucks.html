            NFT Campaign for the Milwaukee Bucks.

            The Milwaukee Bucks hired Mojito to build an exclusive web3 community centered around NFTs
            that granted VIP benefits to their owners.  
        </p>

        <div id="featuredPics" class="grid-container">
            <div class="grid-item-img" style="grid-column: span 4;"><img

        </div>

        <p>
            As Mojito's Go-to-Market Manager, I led this project from concept to launch.
            I served as the Bucks' main point of
            contact, overseeing ideation, design, testing, and launch, while simultaneously managing our internal engineers
            to ensure successful execution on time and on budget. 
            <br><br>
            The primary challenge was onboarding Bucks fans to web3, who for the most part
            were not crypto-native. 
            The back-end lived on the blockchain,
            but we had to make sure the user experience on the front-end felt as familiar as possible.
            Instead of a crypto wallet, users claimed and managed their tokens through a traditional account on the Deer District All Access website.
            They logged in using email and password. No need for crypto. No need for Metamask. 
            <br><br>
            On gameday, the NFT itself was your ticket, 
            which was a novel utility in the industry at the time.
            <br><br>
            I traveled to Fiserv Forum for the launch and surprised some of the members with courtside tickets.
            They were elated!
            <br><br>
            Unfortunately, the project was halted after the market crashed, but it showcased
            innovative fan engagement strategies with a legacy web2 brand.
