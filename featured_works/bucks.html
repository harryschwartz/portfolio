            The Milwaukee Bucks hired Mojito to build an exclusive web3 community centered around NFTs
            that granted VIP benefits to their owners.  
        </p>

        <div id="featuredPics" class="grid-container">
            <div class="grid-item-img" style="grid-column: span 4;"><img
                    src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FQEZBALWUAIj0S2.jpg:large" alt=""></div>
        </div>

        <p>
            As Mojito's Program Manager, I led this project from concept to launch, serving as the Bucks' main point of
            contact. I oversaw ideation, design, testing, and launch, while simultaneously managing our internal engineers
            to ensure successful execution on time and on budget.
            <br><br>
            A critical challenge arose during the 2022 NBA Playoff campaign when we needed to pivot our go-to-market strategy to meet KPIs and OKRs on a tight deadline. Initially, we planned to charge customers for the NFTs. However, after gathering feedback from Bucks leadership and prioritizing product success metrics, we realized this approach conflicted with our primary objective: getting users through the door.
            <br><br>
            We pivoted to a claimable model, recognizing that asking fans to buy crypto for the first time, set up a wallet, and then purchase NFTs was too high a barrier to entry. This strategic shift allowed us to focus on user acquisition and engagement, aligning perfectly with the Bucks' goals for fan outreach during the playoffs.
            <br><br>
            The primary challenge was onboarding Bucks fans to web3, most of whom were not crypto-native. While the back-end lived on the blockchain, we ensured the front-end user experience felt as familiar as possible. Users claimed and managed their tokens through a traditional account on the Deer District All Access website, logging in with email and password. No crypto knowledge or Metamask wallet required.
            <br><br>
            On gameday, the NFT itself served as the ticket, a novel utility in the industry at the time. This seamless integration of web3 technology into a familiar ticketing process showcased our innovative approach to fan engagement.
            <br><br>
            I traveled to Fiserv Forum for the launch and surprised some of the members with courtside tickets, much to their delight. Although the project was eventually halted due to market conditions, it successfully demonstrated innovative fan engagement strategies for a legacy web2 brand transitioning into the web3 space.
