        <p>
           This past year, I
            challenged myself to dive back into coding. I had learned basic Java and C++ at Stanford, which helped me
            manage software engineers at Mojito. However, I wanted to be able to build things on my own, so I enrolled in
            Codecademyâ€™s Full-Stack Developer professional track, learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, Node, and React.
            <br><br>
            My last portfolio was built using a pre-fab website builder. It was nice but boring. A friend of mine (shoutout @_IanWatts_) 
            convinced me that a basic html/css/js site was way cooler than using a template.
            I decided to showcase my coding skills by building this site (yes, the one you are looking at right now)
            from scratch. If you're a software engineer, feel free to inspect the code. The aesthetic represents who I
            am as an engineer: simple, scrappy, and to the point.
            <br><br>
            To be abundantly clear, I am not a professional software engineer. There are plenty of people in this world who
            are better than me at this, but I love doing it. I love building things. And it makes me a better teammate,
            manager, and businessman to have software engineering capabilities.
