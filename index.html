                <p>After graduating college into the pandemic, I spent four years in early stage startups 
                    prototyping a variety of roles in different industries, grounding myself
                    as a professional, and crafting a compass for my future.
                    I prioritized personal and professional growth in order
                    to reflect and redefine an identity that had previously been tethered to football.

                    Making something out of nothing is my favorite pastime. 
                    Whether it be software, hardware, or something in between, I am always tinkering.
                    Hopefully one day one of my projects will turn into a business, 
                    but for now I am just having fun and learning along the way.

                    In Stanford's Design Thinking program I was trained to take a human-centered approach,
                    focusing on "needfinding" to identify and define critical needs before developing solutions. This
                    method ensures that the products I create are desired and used by people, achieving better
                    product-market fit. Additionally, the program emphasizes practical skills in both digital UI/UX and
                    physical prototyping, equipping me to bring ideas to life effectively. This holistic approach
                    enhances my ability to innovate, collaborate, and succeed in diverse professional environments.

                            <em>Harryâ€™s best quality, in my opinion, is the depth of his character. He oozes character and integrity. He also leads with his heart. I witnessed on several occasions Harry go out of his way to uplift colleagues, to deliver hard truths - both to customers and internally - when he could have easily covered things with a white lie, or skirted around them. He always chooses the right path - even if it's the hard one. I trust him implicitly.

                                Harryâ€™s performance was head and shoulders above other well-qualified candidates in similar roles for the following reasons:
                                <br><br>
                                Ability to manage ambiguity: Harry's first assignment involved managing a project on a very short timeline with a client that constantly changed the scope. Harry took charge, led all meetings, persuaded the client to change course midway, and even flew unprompted to the launch site, ensuring our tech surpassed expectations. He built strong client relationships and created essential tools from scratch that we continued to use for future projects.
                                <br><br>
                                Insatiable curiosity: Iâ€™ve never seen someone grow so much in such a short time, and this was largely due to self-directed learning. He asked questions that showed a depth of understanding and foresight that was shocking at times. I let Harry run his own offense with little oversight because he had built so much trust so quickly. 
                                <br><br>
                                Leadership: Harry is a natural leader. His style is defined by his ability to influence, build relationships, and earn credibility through hard work. </em>
