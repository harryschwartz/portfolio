                <p>After graduating college into the pandemic, I prioritized personal and professional growth in order
                    to reflect and redefine an identity that had previously been tethered to football.

                    Working at early stage startups allowed me to prototype roles in different industries, ground myself
                    as a professional, and craft a compass for my future.

                    In Stanford's Design Thinking program I was trained to take a human-centered approach,
                    focusing on "needfinding" to identify and define critical needs before developing solutions. This
                    method ensures that the products I create are desired and used by people, achieving better
                    product-market fit. Additionally, the program emphasizes practical skills in both digital UI/UX and
                    physical prototyping, equipping me to bring ideas to life effectively. This holistic approach
                    enhances my ability to innovate, collaborate, and succeed in diverse professional environments.

                        </p>
                        <p style="color: grey;">
                            <em>Having had the pleasure of mentoring Harry, I can attest to his exceptional combination of intellectual prowess, curiosity, and integrity. Harry joined my team with no prior experience in biotech, yet he quickly built credibility by immersing himself in the field, listening thoughtfully, and asking insightful questions. His ability to synthesize complex scientific data and create compelling narratives for investors was instrumental in advancing two early-stage biotech companies, showcasing his creative genius and strategic thinking.
                                <br><br>
                                Harry’s commitment to personal growth is evident in his intentional approach to his career and life. He focuses not just on advancing his professional skills but also on understanding how to drive meaningful change and work with integrity. His willingness to engage in deep, reflective conversations about leadership and impact demonstrates a maturity and depth of character that sets him apart from his peers.
                                <br><br>
                                Moreover, Harry’s ability to manage ambiguity and thrive in a fluid start-up environment speaks to his exceptional problem-solving skills and adaptability. He has consistently shown that he can take on challenging projects, build strong relationships, and deliver outstanding results. Harry's unique combination of curiosity, creativity, and integrity will make him a valuable asset to any organization.</em>

                            <em>Harry’s best quality, in my opinion, is the depth of his character. He oozes character and integrity. He also leads with his heart. I witnessed on several occasions Harry go out of his way to uplift colleagues, to deliver hard truths - both to customers and internally - when he could have easily covered things with a white lie, or skirted around them. He always chooses the right path - even if it's the hard one. I trust him implicitly. 
                                <br><br>
                                Harry’s performance was head and shoulders above other well-qualified candidates in similar roles for the following reasons:
                                <br><br>
                                Ability to manage ambiguity: Harry's first assignment involved managing a project on a very short timeline with a client that constantly changed the scope. Harry took charge, led all meetings, persuaded the client to change course midway, and even flew unprompted to the launch site, ensuring our tech surpassed expectations. He built strong client relationships and created essential tools from scratch that we continued to use for future projects.
                                <br><br>
                                Insatiable curiosity: I’ve never seen someone grow so much in such a short time, and this was largely due to self-directed learning. He asked questions that showed a depth of understanding and foresight that was shocking at times. I let Harry run his own offense with little oversight because he had built so much trust so quickly. 
                                <br><br>
                                Leadership: Harry is a natural leader. His style is defined by his ability to influence, build relationships, and earn credibility through hard work. </em>
